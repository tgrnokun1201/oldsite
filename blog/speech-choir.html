            </div>
            <h5 style="font-weight: 400">
                <b>Last Wednesday (November 19, 2025)</b>, we had a <b>speech choir</b> competetion at my school. But before I tell you the outcome of our performance, let's get back to the beginning.
                Back in October, our instuctor announced that we will have a speech choir competetion with other sections. Now you maybe asking what is a speech choir?
                It is a <b>group performace</b> where members recite spoken-word pieces like poems or speeches, according to an AI overview from a quick Google search.
            </h5>
            <h5 style="font-weight: 400">
                A few days later after, my classmates started searching for a piece that we will recite. The piece that we will be reciting is
                <b>"I Know Why The Caged Bird Sings"</b> by <u>Maya Angelou</u>. A few weeks later,
                an annoucement by the class president was made that practice is going to start next week and everyone is told to stay at school until 17:00 (5:00pm).
                Anyone who can't put their time for the speech choir practice will be removed and our instructor will give them something else to do. When asked who is availabe to participate for the practice,
                everyone of us raised our hand, indicating that we will.
            </h5>
            <h5 style="font-weight: 400">
                The practice wasn't easy, having the need to sacrifice time for my hobbies, the handful amount of changes needed to be done to our performance, and many more factors.
                And with all of this exhaustion, I started coming up with questions in mind about my decisions. Honestly speaking <b>I do not want to participate</b>,
                yet I did because I do not want to have grades that can be described <i>"sucks ass"</i>.
            </h5>
            <h5 style="font-weight: 400">
                But after all the hardwork and sacrifices, it all come to an end and the final outcome was all worth it. We won not one, but <b>two awards</b>.
                And the second award we got is what makes this all so worth it, because we won as the <b>champion</b> for this competetion.
                The stress, the challenges, and the few extra hours to stay at school just to practice paid off. Our victory is a result that we all very well deserved.
